**b﻿old enough for you?**

*i﻿talics*

*i﻿talics test done done*

s﻿o the formatting of bold and italics is a bit odd

b﻿ut I bet code is cool:

```java
class Eli {
  public void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.printline("Hello World")
  }
}

```

t﻿his is kinda a pain tbh



b﻿ut do pictures work?
