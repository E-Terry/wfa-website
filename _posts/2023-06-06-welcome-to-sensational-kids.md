## At Sensation*al* Kids, we provide occupational therapy services for children and teens in natural settings, focused on sensory-motor integration, facilitated play with peers, and "just-right" challenges.

**Camp Sensation*al* Summer is currently accepting registration forms for an amazing summer experience for your child. Don't miss out!**

* Camp Sensation*al* Summer is a dynamic sensory-motor camp for children who benefit from a small group setting with gentle, respectful, and playful group leaders who are knowledgeable of how the nervous system influences development and behavior. 
* Children with autism, ADHD, learning disabilities/learning differences, sensory processing disorder, low self-esteem, anxiety, and other needs will be well-supported at Camp Sensation*al* Summer. 
* All 4 camp sessions will be filled with activities that enhance sensory processing, gross and fine motor skills, motor planning and coordination, core strength and endurance, attention, and social, communicative, and cooperative play skills
* **Camp Hours: 4 days a week, Monday-Thursday, 10:00 AM-1:00 PM @ our 5-acre Loblolly Farm location off Bent Road in Wake Forest**
* **Space is limited to 6-8 campers per session. Cost is $130 per session (Cost is $125 per session for 2 or more sessions).** 
* **Week 1: June 19-22 Sorcerers, Dungeons, Dragons, and Spells** Build a dungeon and see if you can escape, make a magic wand, slay fire breathing-dragons, mix potions, build a life-size maze with obstacles, battle a knight, and put spells on your friends just for starters. 
* **Week 2: June 26-29 Fairies, Forts, Catapults, and Forest Animals** Swing from the trees, create a fairy village and fairy dust, make a fort, weave a magic carpet, build a catapult, set traps in the woods for your friends, touch the clouds, and crawl through a human size spider web and much more.
* **Week 3: July 10-13 Spies, Traps, Portals, and Superhero Powers** Pull your friends from quicksand, create a treasure map, hide treasure, escape from a deserted island, send a secret message, and leave a fake trail to throw off anyone who is following you. And the best part- use a portal to move from one place to another.
* **Week 4: July 31-Aug 3 Wet, Wacky, and Wild Youtube Video Challenge** Participate in wet, wacky, and wild challenges that we will film and post on our **private** camp youtube channel. Activities will include the world's longest slip and slide, a spaghetti noodle slurping contest, a life-size hungry hippo game, tug of war through a foam swamp, a human chess game, "attack of the spray bottles" t-shirt design contest, and whatever other outrageous ideas the campers come up with that we can pull off.
