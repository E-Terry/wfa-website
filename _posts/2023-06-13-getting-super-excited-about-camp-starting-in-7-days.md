We are busy setting up for camp and just finshed making the cardboard box maze for the castle. My ten year old son, Levi, has tested it out by crawling through it and then by using a prone scooter.  He loves the secret doors that he has to open.  The flaps on the boxes serve as doors on the inside of the maze. Very epic, I think! Can't wait to see all of our campers next week!
